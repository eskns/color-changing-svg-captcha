First off, thank you for considering contributing to SVG Captcha. It's people like you that make SVG Captcha such a great module.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

SVG Captcha is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into SVG Captcha itself.

Ground Rules:
- Ensure all tests pass. Optional, run `npm run lint` to make the linter happy.
- Make sure you only implement ONE feature or bugfix in a pull request. Do not split one line fix in multiple commits to confuse others either.
- Do not add dependencies on other modules. Even better, do not add dev dependencies on other modules.
